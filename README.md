Can be used to calculate a surface from an image
You'll need to give the pixel/meter scale yourself and put it in the code.
When the code is launched, you will see a console with your image, then click around the surface you need to calculate, the press enter to calculate it
For you to zoom, you need to enable the zoom mode by pressing 'z', and then you'll be able to click on the image without putting a point on it
Use 'd' to go back to draw mode.
